# Observational Dynamics (OD) and the tripolar perceptor

We can represent the tripolar system as an observer O coupled to its local environment E.  

Dynamics:
dO/dt = PO - FOE + FEO  
dE/dt = FOE - FEO

Where:

O = Potential energy of the observer (tripolar system)
E = Potential energy of the local environment
PO = Power input to drive the observer
FOE = Energy flow from observer to environment
FEO = Energy flow from environment back to observer

The monopole and dipole components can be modeled as:

Monopole:
FOE = k1 O - k2 E
Radiates observer energy out proportional to local pole O, absorbed by local pole of environment E. Monopole O references a non-local pole.

Dipole:
FEO = k3 ∇E  
Absorbs entropy from local poles of environment based on non-local dipole moment ∇E. Dipole moment emerges from joined local poles with opposite orientations.

This clarifies how the monopole and dipole exchange modes are connected through their local and non-local poles.

Specific forms of the coupling functions FOE and FEO could be defined and simulated to demonstrate the emergent circular causality.

Information Flow:
dI/dt = CI log(1 + FOE/ZEO)
Where CI is the interface capacity and ZEO is the impedance. The emergent gradient ∇E provides perception for directing observer motion.

We can analyze this OD model computationally to study the co-structuring between observer O and environment E. Key behaviors will be circular causality, active participation, and gradient emergence.

Let me know if you would like me to incorporate this updated explanation anywhere else in the documentation.
