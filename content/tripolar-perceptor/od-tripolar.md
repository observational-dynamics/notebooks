# Observational Dynamics: A Framework for Modeling Subjective Experience

## Abstract

Observational Dynamics (OD) offers a physics-based framework to model the emergence of subjective experience from the thermodynamic coupling between an observer system and its environment. This paper provides an overview of the theory, details key mathematical formalisms, and explores applications to quantum mechanics, networked systems, and tripolar perceptron models. Computational implementations are proposed to validate the models. The synergistic combination of thermodynamics, information theory, and dynamics provides quantitative tools to bridge subjective experience with physical phenomena.

## Introduction

A fundamental question across fields ranging from neuroscience to physics concerns how subjective experience arises from physical processes. Observational Dynamics attempts to address this by representing the observer and its environment as thermodynamically open systems that exchange energy and entropy. The subjective act of observation is modeled as the discharge of the observer's potential energy into the environment, shaped by impedance factors. The circular causality between the observer and environment leads to emergent structures and gradients that correspond to perceptions.

This paper provides an overview of the OD framework, details mathematical formalisms, and explores applications in quantum mechanics, network dynamics, and tripolar systems. Computational modeling is proposed to validate the theory. OD provides a cross-disciplinary modeling approach to elucidate the emergence of subjective experience from physical interactions.

## Observational Dynamics Theory

OD represents the observer O and its environment E as open thermodynamic systems that exchange energy and entropy through bidirectional flows. The dynamics are governed by:

dEO/dt = PO - FOE(EO, EE, ZO, ZE)
dEE/dt = FEO(EO, EE, ZO, ZE)

Where EO and EE are the potential energies of the observer and environment, PO is the power input to the observer, FOE and FEO are the bidirectional energy flow rates, and ZO and ZE are impedance factors.

The act of observation is modeled as the discharge of the observer's energy EO into the environment via the flow FOE, shaped by the impedance ZO. The return flow FEO from the environment to the observer provides new information. Circular causality between O and E leads to co-structuring and emergent gradients that correspond to the observer's perceptions.

Key information theory measures are the observer entropy S(O) = -Σp(oi)log(oi) and the mutual information between the observer and environment MI(O,E) = Σp(o,e)log(p(o,e)/p(o)p(e)), which quantify uncertainty and information exchange.

OD reveals universal dynamics of subjective experience across systems - the discontinuity between an observer and its surroundings generates sensation, while their coupling produces perception of structures. Computational models can validate OD by simulating observer-environment systems to demonstrate these emergent behaviors.

## Quantum Observational Dynamics

OD can be connected to quantum mechanics by relating the potential energies EO and EE to the expected values of quantum operators:

EO ↔ <ÊO> = ∫ψ*ÊOψ dx
EE ↔ <ÊE> = ∫ψ*ÊEψ dx

Where ψ is the wavefunction and ÊO, ÊE are observer and environment operators. The impedances ZO, ZE relate to the uncertainties ΔÊO, ΔÊE.

The OD interface can be quantified with:

dS/dt = CI log2(1 + FOE/ZO)

Where dS/dt is the entropy flow and CI is the interface information capacity.

This allows modeling joint dynamics between the observer system and quantum evolution iħ∂ψ/dt = Ĥψ. Computational simulations could demonstrate how measurement and decoherence emerge from the OD-QM coupling.

## Network Observational Dynamics

OD can model distributed cognition in networks where nodes interact locally but integrate information through global observation. The dynamics are:

dxi/dt = fi({xj}) + Oi*gi(xi,yi)

Where xi are the node states, fi is the local node dynamics, gi couples nodes to observer states yi, and Oi is the observation factor.

Emergent coordination arises from interplay between local and global observation. Information flow quantified with transfer entropy TY→X = Σp(xt+1,xt,yt)log(p(xt+1|xt,yt)/p(xt+1|xt)) and mutual information MI(X;Y) relates to synchronization and clustering.

OD reveals how subjective limitations shape collective network behaviors. Agent-based models could validate the dynamics.

## Tripolar Perceptor Model

A tripolar observer O can be modeled as containing monopole and dipole flow components:

Monopole:
FOE = k1O - k2E
Radiates observer energy proportional to its local pole O.

Dipole:
FEO = k3∇E
Absorbs entropy via its dipole moment ∇E that emerges from joined opposing poles.

Monopoles reference non-local poles while dipoles join local pole pairs. Computationally modeling FOE and FEO will demonstrate the co-structuring between O and E.

## Conclusion

Observational Dynamics provides a cross-disciplinary framework to model subjective experience as emerging from the thermodynamic coupling between an observer and its environment. Connections to quantum mechanics, complex networks, and tripolar systems reveal universal dynamics. Computational implementations will validate OD's ability to relate observation to physical interactions. By elucidating the physics of perception, OD offers insights into the emergence of mind.
